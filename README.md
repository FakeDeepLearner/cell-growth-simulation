# Overview
This is a simple application that simulates the division and growth of bacteria in a grid over time. Currently, it feautures a grid that is dynamically resizable (not while a simulation is running or has finished),
a tick rate that can be adjusted to speed up or slow down the simulation (can be changed while simulation is running), and buttons to start, resume and reset the simulation. Additionally, you can place or remove cells from the grid by clicking on individual cells


# Setting up and running locally

## Simply clone this repository 
```
git clone https://github.com/FakeDeepLearner/cell-growth-simulation
```

## then, start the application locally by running
```
npm start
```
